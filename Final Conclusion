Conclusion
This project focused on creating a complete event announcement system on AWS, enabling real-time communication with subscribers through a serverless architecture.

Key highlights:
# Hosted a static website on Amazon S3 to serve as the user interface.
# Built Lambda functions to process subscriptions and create events.
# Used Amazon API Gateway to securely expose backend endpoints.
# Leveraged Amazon SNS for efficient, scalable email notifications.
